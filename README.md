------ WORK IN PROGRESS ------

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ This portfolio is built to showcase my work, creativity, and journey as a fullstack(snackðŸ˜‰) developer. My aim is to create a dynamic and clean website to highlight my projects and newfound skills and to one day be able to show this to future possible employers.

My portfolio is a living project - it grows, changes, and improves as I do as a developer.

Current Tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite
